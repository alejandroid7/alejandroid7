### Welcome :)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on exploring the intersection of **creative graphic design** and **web development** to build visually stunning and functional projects.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Java**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **SQL**, and other tools as part of my studies in **Application Development (D.A.M.)**, while also diving into design tools like Adobe Creative Suite to enhance my creative workflow. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that combine **design** and **development**, especially those that push creative boundariesâ€”Iâ€™m eager to contribute where I can, even as a beginner! 

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advancing my coding skills and understanding best practices in **web development** and **database management** (any guidance or resources are welcome!). 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **graphic design**, **UI/UX principles**, or how to blend creativity with codeâ€”Iâ€™m happy to share what I know! 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to drop me a message here on GitHub.
